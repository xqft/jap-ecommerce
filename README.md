# e-mercado
My e-commerce front-end project for the Jovenes a Programar (Plan Ceibal) webdev course. [GitHub Pages link](https://xqft.github.io/jap-ecommerce/).

The [main]() branch contains the final front-end of the web, which is deployed in Pages. In the [express]() branch is a pretty simple Express/Node.js backend for serving the e-commerce info in JSON. Note that the fetching URLS of the frontend were not updated for this server.
